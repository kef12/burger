#Eat da Burger!
Node, Express, Handlebars

Eat da Burger is a "burger logger" that uses MySQL and Node to query and route data; and Handlebars to generate HTML. 

####Functionality:

* Users input the names of bugers they'd like to devour.

* When a user submits a burger, the application will display the new burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

*Each of the burgers on the left has a 'Devour It!' button, that when clicked, moves the burger to the right side of the page.
